# TCP Socket Echo Server

It's a simple plugin that implements an echo server on a specific port.

## Build

This plugin was implemented using python and you must use the itscam600-plugin-builder (see the step by step to generate the itscam600-plugin-builder on main README) to generate the final plugin.

The development environment is a Linux based and we already created a base build script and you can build the plugin using the follow command:
